# Apni-Dukaan
A common place connecting street vendors directly to customers.
With changing lifestyle and building types, it is becoming difficult for vendors to communicate their presence to the customers. 
To bridge this gap, we intend to amplify the link between street vendors and citizens via a web application called “APNI DUKAAN”.
Customers can now search for local vendors in their vicinity and check the list of items and their prices.
We have used django framework for the backend.
